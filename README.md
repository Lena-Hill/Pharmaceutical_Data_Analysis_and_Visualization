# Pharmaceutical Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
In this analytical project, we examined clinical trial data to explore the efficacy of various drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. The analysis was conducted using datasets containing mouse metadata and clinical study results.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Scipy.stats

## Data Preparation
The data preparation involved merging two CSV files using 'Mouse ID' as a key, cleaning duplicate entries, and performing statistical analysis on the cleaned data.

### Steps:
- Combined mouse metadata and study results.
- Checked and cleaned duplicate records.
- Calculated summary statistics for tumor volumes across different treatment regimens.

## Data Visualization Techniques Employed
- **Bar Plots:** Displayed the number of data entries for each drug regimen using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Pie Charts:** Illustrated the distribution of mice by gender with both libraries.
- **Box Plots:** Showed the distribution of final tumor volumes.
- **Line and Scatter Plots:** Analyzed tumor volume progression over time and its correlation with mouse weight.
- **Linear Regression:** Explored the relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight, highlighting a positive correlation.

## Key Insights
The analysis underscored the varying effectiveness of drug regimens, with some showing significant potential. The positive correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight was confirmed, suggesting further investigative studies could enhance understanding of treatment impacts.

## Conclusion
This project not only demonstrates my capability in handling complex datasets but also my ability to derive actionable insights from data in a biomedical context.
